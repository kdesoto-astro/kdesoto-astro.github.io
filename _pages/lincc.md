The [LINCC Frameworks](https://lsstdiscoveryalliance.org/programs/lincc-frameworks/) team develops analysis software for Rubin data alongside science teams. I previously led a LINCC Frameworks Incubator Program project to develop a stable, user-friendly refactor of Superphot+ that fits light curves 1-2 orders of magnitudes faster than the original version. This updated codebase can keep up with expected Rubin alert rates, therefore enabling same-night prioritization of detected events for follow-up.
