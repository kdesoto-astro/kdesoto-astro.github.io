Currently, I am working with [Dr. Jared Goldberg](https://jaredagoldberg.wordpress.com/) at the [Center for Computational Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/about/) (CCA) to constrain the properties of Type IIP supernova (SN IIP) progenitors from ZTF light curves. Through [JAXtronomy](https://github.com/JAXtronomy) workshops hosted by the CCA, I have also worked to incorporate [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) functionality in my supernova analysis pipelines, enabling rapid parallelization across many CPUs and GPUs.
