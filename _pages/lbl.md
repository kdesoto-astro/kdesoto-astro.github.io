I am currently collaborating with [Dr. Peter Nugent](https://c3.lbl.gov/nugent/) and [Dr. Rob Knop](https://www.sciencecircle.org/dr-rob-knop/) from the [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/) to identify supernovae within the [DECam Deep Drilling Fields](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.519.3881G/abstract) (DDF). This involves differentiating photometry from active galactic nuclei, supernovae, and exotic transients. The DECam DDF dataset is an ideal testing ground for LSST analysis pipelines.
