The [Young Supernova Experiment](https://yse.ucsc.edu/) (YSE) uses the Pan-STARRS telescopes to detect supernovae at very early phases for rapid spectroscopic follow-up. Real-time photometric transient classification and anomaly detection are essential for prioritization of spectroscopic resources. Within YSE, I work on (1) developing these early-time classifiers and (2) jointly encoding YSE data with those from complimentary surveys (such as ZTF).
